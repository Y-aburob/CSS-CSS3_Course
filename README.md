# CSS-CSS3_Course
This is my second course that reviews the most important things in CSS3.     Note: This is not responsive web design ( it works good only on the  PC / laptop ). In the end, I recommended you to study from global sites such as w3school and use my site for quick review no more because I am still a beginner and thank you :D
