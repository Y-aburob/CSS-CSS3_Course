# CSS-CSS3_Course

## This is my second course that reviews the most important things in CSS3.    

### Note:

* *This is not responsive web design ( it works good only on the  PC / laptop ).*

* *At the end, I recommended you to study from global sites such as [W3shool](https://www.w3schools.com/) and use my site for quick review no more because I am still a beginner and thank you for watching :D* .
